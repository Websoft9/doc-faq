# SMTP

Sending mail is a common feature for RabbitMQ. With a large number of users' practice and feedback, only one way is recommended, that is, using the **third-party SMTP service** to send the email.

> Do not try to install **Sendmail** or other Mail server software on your Cloud Server for sending mail, because it has great difficulty in maintenance.

## SMTP diagnosis

If you use the SMTP service provided by a third party (such as QQ mailbox, NetEase mailbox, etc.), the configuration is no problem, but you still cannot send mail. Please check the following questions:

1. Use the **telnet** to connect SMTP service to check it

> The successful Telnet test on the local computer does not mean that the server Telnet is successful, because your server IP address may be blacklisted by the STMP server for some reasons.

~~~
//Install telnet
yum install telnet -y

//sample one：test QQ mail
telnet smtp.qq.com 465

//sample one：test Gmail mail
telnet smtp.gmail.com 465

~~~

When you see the feedback code `220 smtp.*.com Esmtp *Mail Server ` or  `Escape character is '^]'`, it means connection is OK

2. The security group of Cloud Platform set the external access disabled
3. You iptables or firewall disabled the 465 or 587 port which for mail
4. OpenSSL version is low or CA certification have error
