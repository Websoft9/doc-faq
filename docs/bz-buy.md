# Subscription 

Users who have used cloud servers are very aware of the relationship between **Image** and **Server**:

* Image is a necessary component of cloud server, and it is the startup template of cloud server
* You must choose a Image when purchasing a cloud server
* To delete the A Image, you must install the B Image to replace it

Therefore, the purchase (subscription) of the image is equal to the process of deploying the image to the cloud server.
